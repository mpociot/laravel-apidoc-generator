# Documentarian
#### Simply write beautiful API documentation.
========

This project is a PHP port of the popular [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate) API documentation tool.

> If PHP is not your thing and you're more into nodeJS, why not give [Whiteboard](https://github.com/mpociot/whiteboard) a try?

Check out a Documentarian [example API documentation](http://www.marcelpociot.com/whiteboard/).

The documentation is available at [http://marcelpociot.com/documentarian/installation](http://marcelpociot.com/documentarian/installation)


### Slate / Whiteboard compatibility
Since both Documentarian and Slate use regular markdown files to render the API documentation, your existing Slate API documentation should work just fine. If you encounter any issues, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/mpociot/documentarian/issues).

### In depth documentation
For further documentation, read the [Slate Wiki](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki).
