## Installation

Require this package with composer using the following command:

```sh
$ composer require mpociot/laravel-apidoc-generator
```
Using Laravel < 5.5? Go to your `config/app.php` and add the service provider:

```php
Mpociot\ApiDoc\ApiDocGeneratorServiceProvider::class,
```

> Using Laravel < 5.4? Use version 1.0! For Laravel 5.4 and up, use 2.0 instead.

## Usage

To generate your API documentation, use the `apidoc:generate` artisan command.

```sh
$ php artisan apidoc:generate --routePrefix="api/v1/*"

```
You can pass in multiple prefixes by spearating each prefix with comma.

```sh
$ php artisan apidoc:generate --routePrefix="api/v1/*,api/public/*"
```
It will generate documentation for all of the routes whose prefixes are `api/v1/` and `api/public/`


This command will scan your applications routes for the URIs matching `api/v1/*` and will parse these controller methods and form requests. For example:

```php
// API Group Routes
Route::group(array('prefix' => 'api/v1', 'middleware' => []), function () {
	// Custom route added to standard Resource
	Route::get('example/foo', 'ExampleController@foo');
	// Standard Resource route
	Route::resource('example', 'ExampleController');
});
```

### Available command options:

Option | Description
--------- | -------
`output` | The output path used for the generated documentation. Default: `public/docs`
`routePrefix` | The route prefix(es) to use for generation. `*` can be used as a wildcard. Multiple route prefixes can be specified by separating them with a comma (for instance `/v1,/v2`)
`routeDomain` | The route domain(s) to use for generation. `*` can be used as a wildcard. Multiple route domains can be specified by separating them with a comma 
`routes` | The route names to use for generation - Required if no routePrefix or routeDomain is provided
`middleware` | The middlewares to use for generation
`noResponseCalls` | Disable API response calls
`noPostmanCollection` | Disable Postman collection creation
`useMiddlewares` | Use all configured route middlewares (Needed for Laravel 5.3 `SubstituteBindings` middleware)
`actAsUserId` | The user ID to use for authenticated API response calls
`router` | The router to use, when processing the route files (can be Laravel or Dingo - defaults to Laravel)
`bindings` | List of route bindings that should be replaced when trying to retrieve route results. Syntax format: `binding_one,id|binding_two,id`
`force` | Force the re-generation of existing/modified API routes
`header` | Custom HTTP headers to add to the example requests. Separate the header name and value with ":". For example: `--header="Authorization: CustomToken"`

## Publish rule descriptions for customisation or translation.

 By default, this package returns the descriptions in english. You can publish the packages language files, to customise and translate the documentation output.

 ```sh
 $ php artisan vendor:publish
 ```

 After the files are published you can customise or translate the descriptions in the language you want by renaming the `en` folder and editing the files in `public/vendor/apidoc/resources/lang`.


### How does it work?

This package uses these resources to generate the API documentation:

#### Controller doc block

This package uses the HTTP controller doc blocks to create a table of contents and show descriptions for your API methods.

Using `@resource` in a doc block prior to each controller is useful as it creates a Group within the API documentation for all methods defined in that controller (rather than listing every method in a single list for all your controllers), but using `@resource` is not required. The short description after the `@resource` should be unique to allow anchor tags to navigate to this section. A longer description can be included below. Custom formatting and `<aside>` tags are also supported. (see the [Documentarian docs](http://marcelpociot.de/documentarian/installation/markdown_syntax))

Above each method within the controller you wish to include in your API documentation you should have a doc block. This should include a unique short description as the first entry. An optional second entry can be added with further information. Both descriptions will appear in the API documentation in a different format as shown below.

```php
/**
 * @resource Example
 *
 * Longer description
 */
class ExampleController extends Controller {

	/**
	 * This is the short description [and should be unique as anchor tags link to this in navigation menu]
	 *
	 * This can be an optional longer description of your API call, used within the documentation.
	 *
	 */
	 public function foo(){

	 }
```

**Result:**

#### Form request validation rules

To display a list of valid parameters, your API methods accepts, this package uses Laravel's [Form Requests Validation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/validation#form-request-validation).


```php
public function rules()
{
    return [
        'title' => 'required|max:255',
        'body' => 'required',
        'type' => 'in:foo,bar',
        'thumbnail' => 'required_if:type,foo|image',
    ];
}
```

**Result:** ![Form Request](http://marcelpociot.de/documentarian/form_request.png)

### A note on custom validation rules
This package only supports custom rules defined as classes. You'll also need to define a `__toString()` method in the class, which should return the description that would be displayed in the generated doc.

#### Controller method doc block
It is possible to override the results for the response. This will also show the responses for other request methods then GET.

#### @transformer
With the transformer you can define the transformer that is used for the result of the method. It will try the next parts to get a result if it can find the transformer. The first successfull will be used.

1. Check if there is a transformermodel tag to define the model
2. Get a model from the modelfactory
2. If the parameter is a Eloquent model it will load the first from the database.
3. A new instance from the class

```php
/**
 * @transformer \Mpociot\ApiDoc\Tests\Fixtures\TestTransformer
 */
public function transformerTag()
{
    return '';
}
```

#### @transformercollection
This is the same idea as the @tranformer tag with one different, instead of the return of an item, it will generate the return of a set with two items

```php
/**
 * @transformercollection \Mpociot\ApiDoc\Tests\Fixtures\TestTransformer
 */
public function transformerCollectionTag()
{
    return '';
}
```

#### @transformermodel
The @transformermodel tag is needed for PHP 5.* to get the model. For PHP 7 is it optional to specify the model that is used for the transformer.

#### @response
If you explicitly want to specify the result of a function you can set it in the docblock as JSON, using the `@response` annotation:

```php
/**
 * @response {
 *  "token": "eyJ0eXAi…",
 *  "roles": ["admin"]
 * }
 */
public function responseTag()
{
    return '';
}
```

#### API responses

If your API route accepts a `GET` method, this package tries to call the API route with all middleware disabled to fetch an example API response. 

If your API needs an authenticated user, you can use the `actAsUserId` option to specify a user ID that will be used for making these API calls:

```sh
$ php artisan apidoc:generate --routePrefix="api/*" --actAsUserId=1
```

If you don't want to automatically perform API response calls, use the `noResponseCalls` option.

```sh
$ php artisan apidoc:generate --routePrefix="api/*" --noResponseCalls
```

> Note: The example API responses work best with seeded data.

#### Postman collections

The generator automatically creates a Postman collection file, which you can import to use within your [Postman App](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) for even simpler API testing and usage.

If you don't want to create a Postman collection, use the `--noPostmanCollection` option, when generating the API documentation.

As of Laravel 5.3, the default base URL added to the Postman collection will be that found in your Laravel `config/app.php` file. This will likely be `http://localhost`. If you wish to change this setting you can directly update the url or link this config value to your environment file to make it more flexible (as shown below):

```php
'url' => env('APP_URL', 'http://yourappdefault.app'),
```

If you are referring to the environment setting as shown above, then you should ensure that you have updated your `.env` file to set the APP_URL value as appropriate. Otherwise the default value (`http://yourappdefault.app`) will be used in your Postman collection. Example environment value:

```
APP_URL=http://yourapp.app
```

## Modify the generated documentation

If you want to modify the content of your generated documentation, go ahead and edit the generated `index.md` file.
The default location of this file is: `public/docs/source/index.md`.
 
After editing the markdown file, use the `apidoc:update` command to rebuild your documentation as a static HTML file.

```sh
$ php artisan apidoc:update
```

As an optional parameter, you can use `--location` to tell the update command where your documentation can be found.

## Automatically add markdown to the beginning or end of the documentation
 If you wish to automatically add the same content to the docs every time you generate, you can add a `prepend.md` and/or `append.md` file to the source folder, and they will be included above and below the generated documentation.
 
 **File locations:**
- `public/docs/source/prepend.md` - Will be added after the front matter and info text
- `public/docs/source/append.md` - Will be added at the end of the document

## Skip single routes

If you want to skip a single route from a list of routes that match a given prefix, you can use the `@hideFromAPIDocumentation` tag on the Controller method you do not want to document.

## Further modification

This package uses [Documentarian](https://github.com/mpociot/documentarian) to generate the API documentation. If you want to modify the CSS files of your documentation, or simply want to learn more about what is possible, take a look at the [Documentarian guide](http://marcelpociot.de/documentarian/installation).
